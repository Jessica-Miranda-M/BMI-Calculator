## 🛠️ Technical Challenges & Evolution

During this project, I focused on identifying technical hurdles and applying industry-standard solutions:

### 1. Dynamic UI & User Experience (UX)
* **Challenge:** Creating a smooth way for users to input height without excessive typing.
* **Solution:** Implemented a **SeekBar** to allow real-time height selection, synchronizing UI components instantly.

### 2. Error Handling & App Stability
* **Challenge:** Preventing app crashes caused by empty fields or invalid numeric inputs.
* **Solution:** Applied **Try-Catch** blocks and string validation to ensure the app remains stable and provides user-friendly feedback via Toasts.

### 3. Resource Management (Clean Code)
* **Challenge:** Avoiding hardcoded values that make maintenance difficult.
* **Solution:** Centralized all strings and colors in **XML resource files** (`strings.xml`, `colors.xml`), following Android best practices for scalability.

### 4. Advanced Version Control
* **Challenge:** Solving synchronization conflicts between local and remote repositories.
* **Solution:** Mastered commands like `git pull --rebase` to maintain a clean, linear, and professional project history.

### My Evolution During this Project
This project represents a turning point in my learning journey as an Android developer. At the beginning, I made mistakes such as using hardcoded values and not properly validating user input, which sometimes caused instability. Instead of ignoring these issues, I chose to understand them deeply and improve my approach. I learned how to organize resources correctly, handle errors more responsibly, and manage version control conflicts with more confidence. Looking back, I can clearly see my growth — not only in technical skills, but in the way I think, structure, and take responsibility for my code.


## 🔧 Technologies Used
